# Optimizing NYPD Resource Allocation
## Unveiling Insights Through an ETL Pipeline with NYC Open Data API, PostgreSQL, Apache Spark, and Flask

In response to the surge in major crime rates in NYC, our team developed a web application tool aimed at mitigating this issue. We designed and implemented a robust ETL pipeline to curate essential data, which served as the foundation for developing a web application tailored for NYPD officials. This dynamic tool not only identifies precincts with elevated crime rates, but also highlights those with a disproportionate incidence of major crimes. By utilizing the NYC Open Data API, PostgreSQL, Apache Spark, and Flask, we've created a powerful solution empowering officials to strategically allocate NYPD resources, ultimately fostering informed decision-making for safer communities.
